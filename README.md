**About**

> "The natural healing force within each one of us The Greatest Force in getting well. Our food should be our medicine. Our medicine should be our food."

Our Darling Project "Sonomi, garden of hope" by all means shows our enthusiasm towards Mother Nature and all the resources it has offered Us as Humans to keep our health and wellbeing at an optimum level.
