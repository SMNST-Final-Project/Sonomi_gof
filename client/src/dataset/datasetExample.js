This could help explain why chamomile oil has been used for digestive conditions like indigestion and cramping.Chamomile ointment had significantly higher wound healing and antibacterial activity compared to tetracycline ointment and placebo.Low morning levels of a hormone called cortisol have been linked with anxiety disorders. A small 2018 studyTrusted Source found that chamomile therapy helped reduce anxiety symptoms and increased morning cortisol levels.To use chamomile oil in massage oil, you’ll first need to dilute it in a carrier oil.
